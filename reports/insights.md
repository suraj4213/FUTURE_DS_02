## Campaign Performance Insights

Generated from `outputs/campaign_metrics_powerbi.csv` on 2025-11-21.

### Channel Highlights
- **Facebook** delivered the strongest efficiency with ROI ≈ 209% and ROAS ≈ 3.09 on $5.3M spend, making it the lead candidate for incremental investment.
- **Twitter** (ROI ≈ 185%, ROAS ≈ 2.85) closely trailed Facebook on reach but under-indexed slightly on conversion efficiency—optimize targeting/creative before scaling.
- **Instagram** provided balanced reach (80.8M impressions) with moderate ROI (≈179%); prioritize high-engagement ad types (Stories/Video) to close the gap.

### Creative & Objective Findings
- **Video ads** topped the ROAS ranking (~2.98) followed by Story (~2.94) and Carousel (~2.90). Static images lagged (2.83); shift creatives toward motion-based formats.
- Campaigns with **Conversion** or **Traffic** objectives produced ROI > 197%, confirming that lower-funnel optimization drives the best returns across platforms.

### Audience & Seasonal Patterns
- Age group **25–34** achieved the highest ROI (~199%), while 18–24 trailed at ~183%; allocate remarketing budget to the 25–44 cohorts.
- Revenue spikes appeared in **January** and **May 2024**, suggesting seasonality linked to New Year and pre-summer promotions—plan budget pulses accordingly.

### Cost Efficiency
- Average CPC remained below $2.50 across platforms; CPM stayed under $70 with Facebook lowest. Maintain frequency caps to preserve CPM advantage.
- Underperforming cohort: campaigns with ROI < 100% represent ~14% of spend; investigate targeting overlap and creative fatigue.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Reallocate +10% budget** from low-ROI Instagram image campaigns toward Facebook video campaigns targeting 25–34 year olds.
2. **Launch iterative testing** on Twitter using conversion-optimized objectives plus refreshed creative to lift ROAS above 3.0.
3. **Prepare seasonal kits** for January/May windows, ensuring high-intent offers are ready 4 weeks prior.
4. **Automate alerting** for ROI < 100% or ROAS < 1.5 using Power BI data-driven alerts / Looker Studio email schedules.
